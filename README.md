# SigScan
## Application that displays new image files, in a directory.

 1. [Download the zip](https://github.com/BOXNYC/sigscan/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and install on your computer. Take note where you extract it.
 2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) from the installer App. __If this doesn't work, LMK and I'll help.__ 
 3. Run the INSTALL.app by double-clicking it, and it will open your browser to http://localhost:3000 which is the website to open fullscreen. __If that doesn't work, change it to :3001, :3002, etc.__
 4. On the scanner app, choose the output directory to be where you extracted this directory in step 1, but choose the directory [EXTRACTED_DIRECTORY]/public/signatures
